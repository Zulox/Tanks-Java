#TANK Java Game
This is a game where you will take control of a tank, the main goal of the game is to destory the enemy A.I tank
you will control the tank by telling it instruction on what kind of moves it would take


#How To Play
The Tank can only move up, down, left or right, and shoot up, down, left or right. The AI sequence is 15 of
these moves.

At the start of the game, the AI generates a new random sequence of commands for the AI’s robot.

The player then has to select 15 commands for the player's tank. Then the round starts, and the player run their
respective sequences, animated on the screen.

If the player’s tank manages to kill the AI’s tank, then the human has won the game. If not, then the
player has to write a new sequence to try to do that.

The aim of the game is for the player to take the least number of tries before their TANK manages to kill the

AI’s TANK. So, for example, if it only takes the Player 3 tries, it’s a better result than if it takes the Player 10

tries.
